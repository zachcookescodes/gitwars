// The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

// For example:

// 1.08 --> 30

// Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.


function cockroachSpeed(s) {
    return Math.floor((s*10000)/360);
  }


// const cockroachSpeed = s => Math.floor(s / 0.036);

// Your function takes two arguments:

//     current father's age (years)
//     current age of his son (years)

// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
